        This function uses a generator that yields a timeseries data point from a data source.  When the data source
        yields a timeseries data point in the form of the pair: (timestamp, value), the data point is put into a buffer
        that consists of two parallel arrays: self.regress_buffX and self.regress_buffY. This buffer's size is maintained
        at the size specified by self.regress_plot_size.  If the buffer is filled, the oldest by timestamp is removed,
        and the new data point is appended, thereby maintaining a fixed size buffer.  When the buffer is filled, the
        following process is put into action:
        (1)  Calculate the linear regression line for the points currently in the buffer.
        (2)  Calculate the coordinates of the two endpoints of the regression line.  The starting endpoint corresponds
             to the oldest point in the buffer, while the ending endpoint corresponds to the newest point in the buffer.
        (3)  Calculate the STD and MEAN for the points in the buffer.
        (4)  For the newest endpoint in the buffer, calculate the y difference between the data point and the regression
             line.  This y difference will be used in the plot.
        (5)  Compare the y difference with the value (self.anomaly_std_factor * STD).  If the value is outside
             this calculation, set the plot color to 'red'.
